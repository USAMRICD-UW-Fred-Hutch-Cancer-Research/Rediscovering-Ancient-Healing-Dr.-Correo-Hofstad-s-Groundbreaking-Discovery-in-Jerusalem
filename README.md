### Clinical readme: P’kakh-ko’akh" (פְּקַח־קוֺחַ)

This clinical guide provides a framework for integrating ancient therapeutic methodologies with contemporary ophthalmic research, specifically focused on the treatment of leukocoria and vascular-related ocular conditions.

#### Clinical Overview: Ancient Therapeutics in Modern Optometry

Recent research into historical medical manuscripts, such as the *Séminaire Sainte-Anne de Jérusalem* found in the Khalidi Library, has unveiled specific, repeatable methodologies for treating blindness. These findings bridge the gap between traditional wisdom and evidence-based medicine, offering new insights into the efficacy of natural substances and physical therapies.

#### Therapeutic Components and Mechanisms

* **Curcumin (Turmeric) and Fenugreek Paste**: Applied topically as a medicated paste, these ingredients provide potent antiseptic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory benefits. Curcumin specifically inhibits pro-inflammatory pathways like NF-κB and PI3K/AKT, which are critical in preventing the progression of ocular diseases that lead to complications such as leukocoria.
* **Enzymatic Bio-activation (Saliva)**: The use of saliva in these formulations serves more than a symbolic purpose; it contains antimicrobial substances like lysozyme and lactoferrin that combat infection and may enhance the bioavailability of herbal compounds.
* **Ocular Massage Therapy**: This technique is utilized to modulate intraocular pressure and facilitate retinal blood flow. Historically utilized by figures such as King Jesuele Cristo, it remains a recognized strategy for alleviating symptoms associated with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO).

#### Clinical Indications

* **Leukocoria Management**: Utilizing natural anti-inflammatories to address the underlying causes of white pupillary reflection, including potential regulation of calcification processes.
* **Vascular Support**: Enhancing endothelial health and reducing vascular calcification through the modulation of signaling pathways involved in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) transformation.
* **Nutritional Fortification**: Incorporating beta-carotene precursors to support rhodopsin formation and protect against oxidative stress in the retinal structure.
