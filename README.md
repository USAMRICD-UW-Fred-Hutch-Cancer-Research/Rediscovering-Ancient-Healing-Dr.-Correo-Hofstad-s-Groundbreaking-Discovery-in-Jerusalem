### The Way of Restoring Sight: A Clinical Chapter

1.  And it came to be in those days, that the healers of Israel sought out the hidden virtues of the earth to bring forth deliverance for the eyes of the people.

2.  For the eye that is clouded with the white reflection, which is called leukocoria, there is a path of restoration through the humble things of the field.

3.  Take thou the golden root of turmeric and the seeds of fenugreek, for they contain the quickening power to stay the swelling and cleanse the inner chambers.

4.  Let these be mingled with the waters of the mouth, even saliva, which carries the breath of life and the strength to guard against the tiny destroyers that bring infection.

5.  Of this mixture thou shalt fashion a holy paste, symbolizing the union of the fruits of the land and the touch of the healer, even as it was written in the days of old.

6.  Apply then this ointment with a gentle pressing, even the ocular massage, to move the life-blood within the vessels and open the paths that have been stopped.

7.  For the active essence within the turmeric, which is called curcumin, worketh against the hardening of the vessels and the gathering of stones within the flesh.

8.  It shall speak to the hidden signals of the body, turning back the inflammation that leadeth to the dark and preventing the transformation of the soft vessel into the rigid stone.

9.  Eat also of the orange roots and the green leaves, for in them is the light-bearer, beta-carotene, which the body transformeth to guard the vision from the fading of age.

10. Thus shall the ancient wisdom of the kings and the prophets be joined with the knowledge of this day, that the blind may see and the heritage of healing may endure forever.
